# HTTP Toolkit Pro Patcher

Hi.

You're probably here because you've been searching for a crack for HTTP Toolkit Pro, so you can use the paid HTTP Toolkit features for free.

I'm the developer behind HTTP Toolkit, and I've done my best to make HTTP Toolkit available and affordable for everybody, but I get it - sometimes you need a paid tool but the pricing just doesn't work for you right now.

If you need free access to HTTP Toolkit, let me know. I'm happy to set up free Pro accounts for:

* Students - send an email from your university/school/etc email address to confirm this, ask a professor to do so for you, or share your student id or similar.
* Non-profits & charities - send an email from your organization email address, and share some details to confirm the non-profit status.
* Full-time open-source devs - send a message from an email with some kind of link to your GitHub profile or equivalent (e.g. from email address shown there, or your git commit email) and explain what you're working on and how HTTP Toolkit helps.
* Anybody who really needs it but just cannot afford it right now - get in touch, let me know what's up, and I can help.

In addition, **all open-source contributors to HTTP Toolkit get free HTTP Toolkit Pro**! Helping to build the project is the best way to get Pro if you can't help fund HTTP Toolkit's development yourself.

Open a pull request to fix a little bug or a typo, improve the docs, or make even a small step towards a feature you've always dreamed of, and HTTP Toolkit Pro is free. Take a look at [the issues list](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) if you're looking for some ideas, feel free to improvise, and get in touch if you want any help. All contributions welcome. There's a getting started guide for contribution [here](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit/#contributing-directly).

In all cases - to get Pro, just send me an email at pro-request @ httptoolkit.com and explain your situation. Please be aware that I get a lot of messages, and if you don't verifiably fit into one of the above categories you may not receive a response at all, so please include all the details requested above in your message.

**However**, if you're not in those categories - for example you're somebody being paid to work on software professionally, so you're making money from using HTTP Toolkit - **please do sign up for Pro and help support the project**. HTTP Toolkit is a tiny 100% open-source project with exactly one full-time employee (me). It's not a mega corporation, it's a small indie project that needs your funding to keep developing. There's costs to running the project and its servers, and I have to actually pay myself enough that I work on HTTP Toolkit full time without distractions, so do please help contribute to the costs and keep the project running and growing.

Any questions? Get in touch.
