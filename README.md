# HTTP Toolkit Pro Patcher

Hi.

You're probably here because you've been searching for a crack for HTTP Toolkit Pro, so you can use the paid HTTP Toolkit features for free.

I'm the developer behind HTTP Toolkit, and I've done my best to make HTTP Toolkit available and affordable for everybody, but I get it - sometimes you need a paid tool but the pricing just doesn't work for you right now.

**If you need free access to HTTP Toolkit, let me know**. I'm happy to set up free Pro accounts for:

* Students - just send an email from your university/school/etc email address to confirm this, or ask a professor to do so for you.
* Non-profits & charities - just send an email from your organization email address, and share some details to confirm your non-profit status.
* Full-time open-source devs - send a message with some kind of link to your GitHub profile (e.g. from email address shown there).
* Anybody who really needs it but just can't afford it right now - get in touch, let me know what's up, and I can help.

In addition, **all open-source contributors to HTTP Toolkit get free HTTP Toolkit Pro**. Fix a little bug or a typo, improve the docs, make even a small step towards a feature you've always dreamed of, and HTTP Toolkit Pro is free. Take a look at [the issues list](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) if you're looking for some ideas, feel free to improvise, and get in touch if you want any help. All contributions welcome. There's a getting started guide for contribution [here](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit/#contributing-directly).

In all cases - just send me an email at tim @ httptoolkit.com and let me know your situation.

**However**, if you're not in those categories, for example you're somebody being paid to work on software professionally, so you're making money from using HTTP Toolkit, **please do sign up for Pro and help support the project**.

HTTP Toolkit is a tiny 100% open-source project with exactly one full-time employee (me). It's not a mega corporation, it's a small indie project that needs your funding to keep developing. There's costs to running the project, in addition to actually paying myself a salary so I can continue to focus on HTTP Toolkit full time, so do please help contribute to the costs and keep the project running.

Any questions? [Get in touch](https://httptoolkit.com/contact/).
